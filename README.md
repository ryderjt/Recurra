## Overview

MacroRecorder lays the groundwork for a modern SwiftUI desktop application that can capture low-level keyboard and mouse events using `CGEventTap`, then replay them with precision. This repository provides a clean starting point for further development, packaging, and distribution as a DMG installer.

## Features

- ‚ú® Minimalist gradient UI with a split sidebar and responsive controls.
- ‚å®Ô∏è Captures keyboard and mouse activity via `CGEventTap` with precise timing.
- üìö Macro library with timestamps, inline actions to replay or delete, and detail cards.
- ‚è±Ô∏è Playback engine that replays events at the recorded cadence.
- ‚åò Global hotkeys (`‚åò‚å•R` to toggle recording, `‚åò‚å•P` to replay the latest macro).
- ‚ôø Guided Accessibility permission flow that deep-links to System Settings when needed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15 or newer
- macOS 13 Ventura or newer

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/MacroRecorder.git
   cd MacroRecorder
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open MacroRecorder.xcodeproj
   ```
3. Update the signing team and bundle identifier in **Signing & Capabilities**.
4. Build and run the app on your Mac. On first launch, macOS will prompt for Accessibility permissions so the app can monitor and control input events.

## Usage
- Launch the app and grant Accessibility permissions when prompted so macOS allows input monitoring.
- Use the **Record** button (or `‚åò‚å•R`) to start capturing mouse and keyboard events.
- Stop the recording to save it in the sidebar, optionally renaming the macro beforehand.
- Select any saved macro to view details and press **Replay** (or `‚åò‚å•P`) to play it back at the captured speed.
- Delete macros from the list when they are no longer needed.

## Contributing
We welcome community contributions! To propose a change:
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Implement your changes, including tests or documentation where appropriate.
3. Submit a pull request describing your improvements.
4. Participate in the review process to get your contribution merged.

Please follow the [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/) and include descriptive commit messages.

## Upcoming Features
- Conditional macros and branching logic for smarter automation.
- Inline timeline editor with drag-to-adjust timings.
- Lightweight scripting hooks for custom actions between recorded steps.
- Persistent storage and syncing of the macro library.
- Export/import functionality for sharing macros.
